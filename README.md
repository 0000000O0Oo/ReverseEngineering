# Reverse Engineering Adventures
This will be our Reverse Engineering section, we will try to solve and complete a tons of different Reverse Engineering challenge, i am trying to sharpen my skill
as most as possible as a Reverse Engineer, this will be benefic to my knowledge and i'm pretty sure you won't regret following the same path as i did take.

## What is Reverse Engineering ?
To get a good definition of what is really Reverse Engineering i wen't on `wikipedia`,... Yeah i know pretty lame. 

**Reverse engineering** (also known as backwards engineering or back engineering) is a process or method through the application of which one attempts to 
`understand through deductive reasoning how a device, process, system, or piece of software accomplishes a task with very little (if any) insight into 
exactly how it does so.` 

In our case, we're `Reverse Engineering programs (Binary Executables)`, to do that we're using `Decompilers`, `Debuggers`, `Disassemblers`, `Hex Editors`, `PE Structure Analysis tool` and many more... note that you can `reverse engineer` pretty much anything that has been `engineered` in the first place.

## How can i learn Reverse Engineering
Learning Reverse Engineering can be a really daunting task to accomplish, but it's totally worth it...
My "go to" to learn reverse engineering was `Assembly Books`, `Binary Analysis Books`, `Online Courses`, `A LOT of Practice`, and `Books on C/C+`.
If you have dig in pretty much all of this, i think you're good to go.

I would also highly consider reading the book offered at `https://beginners.re`, and practice the stuff you learned from that book on `https://challenges.re`
If you can't afford the 1$ paywall hit me up and i'll send you the PDFs.

## Where can i find Reverse Engineering Challenges
There is a LOT of challenges online i do a lot of CrackMe and CTF Challenges and it truly helped me understand a lot more what im doing.
Here's a couple of Website where you can practice :
    - reversing.kr
    - challenges.re
    - crackmes.one <= My Favorite So Far
    
These 3 platforms are the main ones we are going to use in this section.

Also, we're going to do a lot of CTF Challenges, you can check the upcoming CTF everyweek at ctftime.org.
